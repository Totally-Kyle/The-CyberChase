### Sprint 1 Progress

The EDA revealed underlying correlation between groups of data. We will use this to remove columns that are 100% redundant, and to group our data together in our database. We are going to combine the days together and create a column to identify which day the data was recorded. We also will be using a package to transform the Src IP column into the country which the IP is from. There is also code that we may use to turn our timestamp column into a more interpretable form that has not been finalized.

The progress we have made in understanding the columns and how they relate together is astounding. Our next steps will be finalizing what we will load into the PostgreSQL database and making any further transformations. We also must focus on the stories we wish to tell with this data when looking to load our data so we can create the most efficient dashboard.
