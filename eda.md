Most of my EDA was dropping numerical features. Highly correlated features (correlation > 0.97) such as Fwd IAT Total, Fwd Act Data Pkts, and Fwd Header Length were dropped for more central metrics like Flow Duration and Total Fwd Packet. Similarly, repetitive statistical summaries (mean, min, max, std) across packet lengths, inter-arrival times, and activity windows were reduced to mean and std. Features like Bwd Header Length, Packet Length Variance, and bulk or subflow averages were also removed, offering minimal additional value.

I only transformed object features to improve interpretability. IP addresses were mapped to countries using GeoIP; timestamps were converted to extract hour of day, weekday, and weekend flags for time based patterns in traffic behavior (more so thinking about when the csv files get combined). Flow ID was dropped having no predictive power. I feel like the final dataset is diverse but manageable; focused on features capturing volume, timing, protocol behavior, flow characteristics, and directional balance.
